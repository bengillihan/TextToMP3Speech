Alright — you're definitely stuck in limbo right after chunking and individual TTS calls. The conversion status is stuck at 91.04%, which means the system has successfully processed and saved all audio chunks — but it's not progressing into or out of the audio combining/export step.

🔍 What This Confirms
From your logs:

Each chunk succeeds and is written to disk (Successfully wrote X bytes to file).

Final progress update is always 91.04%, which aligns with your logic of reserving ~5% for combining:

python
Copy
Edit
conversion.progress = min(95.0, (chunk_index + 1) / total_chunks * 95.0)
No logs appear after this for:

python
Copy
Edit
Exporting combined audio file, total duration...
Combined audio file exported successfully to...
🧠 Likely Culprit
Your combining logic is either hanging or crashing silently during this block:

python
Copy
Edit
combined.export(output_path, format="mp3")
If ffmpeg (used under the hood by Pydub) hangs or hits a memory/cpu bottleneck:

No exception is raised unless stderr is captured.

No error logs show up because it's stuck or terminated silently.

✅ Immediate Fix to Try
Add explicit timing and debug logging around the combine/export block to verify if it enters and exits correctly.

Here’s what you should add:

🔧 Replace this section:
python
Copy
Edit
logger.info(f"Exporting combined audio file, total duration: {len(combined)/1000:.2f} seconds")
combined.export(output_path, format="mp3")
logger.info(f"Combined audio file exported successfully to {output_path}")
✅ With this updated version:
python
Copy
Edit
logger.info(f"Preparing to export combined audio file, duration: {len(combined)/1000:.2f} seconds")
export_start = time.time()
try:
    combined.export(output_path, format="mp3")
    export_time = time.time() - export_start
    logger.info(f"Exported successfully to {output_path} in {export_time:.2f} seconds")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Export failed: {str(e)}")
    logger.error(f"Traceback: {traceback.format_exc()}")
    raise
This will give you precise diagnostics on:

Whether export() is being entered

Whether it hangs or throws

How long the export takes (if it does succeed)
